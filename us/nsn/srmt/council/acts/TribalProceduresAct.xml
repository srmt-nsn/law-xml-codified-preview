    <heading>Title - Tribal Procedures Act</heading>
    <text>This Ordinance shall pertain to the government of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe (hereafter referred to as "Tribe") and shall be known as the Saint Regis Mohawk "Tribal Procedures Act".</text>

    <heading>Purpose</heading>
    <text>This Ordinance will replace the "Act relating to Tribal Council Powers, Procedures, Initiative Referendum, Recall and Removal from Office" commonly referred to as the 1994 Procedures Act. This Ordinance significantly revises the 1994 Procedures Act by giving enrolled Tribal Members (hereafter referred to as Members) a greater voice in Tribal Government and making the Tribal Government more transparent and accountable to Members. The Ordinance allows more Member participation in the Tribal Government, makes it much less burdensome for Members to initiate petitions to enact laws, reject laws and place questions before the membership in a referendum process. The Ordinance also makes the Tribal Council's (hereafter referred to as Council) actions more transparent and open by requiring the Council to conduct its business through regular meetings open to the membership. In addition, the Ordinance establishes rules or conduct and procedures for Tribal Monthly Meetings, provides for a process allowing Members to review Tribal budgets and also allows Members access to public Tribal records.</text>
