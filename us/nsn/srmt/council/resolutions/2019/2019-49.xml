If the amount falls between the FPL and the SSR, then the presumptive amount will be $25.00 per month ($300.00 annually). If the amount falls below the FPL, then the presumptive amount will be $0.00. If the amount is greater than the SSR, then the low-income limitations do not affect the obligation and the presumptive amount will be the Child Support Obligation as calculated.</text>
