      <text>The St. Regis Mohawk Tribal Council ("Council" or "Tribal Council") hereby finds that:</text>
      <para>
        <num>(1)</num>
        <text>Due to the unique legal status of lands on the St. Regis Mohawk Indian Reservation ("Reservation"), it is difficult for members of the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe ("Tribe") to purchase homes utilizing traditional financing methods.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(2)</num>
        <text>In order to alleviate this situation, which exists on all Indian reservations and lands, federal agencies such as the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") and the U.S. Department of Agriculture ("USDA") have established Indian housing loan guarantee programs.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(3)</num>
        <text>In order for the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe and its members to participate in any mortgage loan program, whether guaranteed or conventional for either residential or commercial purposes, it must first establish the required legal and administrative framework to allow for Reservation land parcels to be used as a security interest for mortgages.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(4)</num>
        <text>Currently, individual tribal member land interests on the St. Regis Mohawk Indian Reservation are held pursuant to a tribal member's Deed of Right to Use and Occupancy that is approved by the Tribal Council and filed with the Tribal Clerk's office.</text>
      </para>

      <heading>Purpose</heading>
      <text>The purpose of this ordinance is to convert and structure the current land interests into tribal land assignments so that such may be pledged as security for a mortgage; and to create a land assignment process to protect the interests of the tribal member borrower, the lender, and any federal agency that is involved.</text>
