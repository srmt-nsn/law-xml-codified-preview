        <aftertext>The purpose of these water quality standards is to facilitate sovereign self-determination and the restoration and preservation of traditional hunting, fishing, gathering and cultural uses in, on and around Tribal Surface Waters. The Environment Division is committed to providing cleaner, safer water for all of creation. These water quality standards will in turn promote the general welfare and well-being of the community by allowing the Tribe and its members to utilize the water for traditional, cultural and ceremonial purposes. Water quality standards are not used to control, and are not invalidated by, natural background phenomena or acts of the Creator.</aftertext>
        <aftertext>These purposes shall be accomplished by utilizing the standards set forth in the Tribe's Water Quality Standards as the basis for permitting and management process for point source discharges and nonpoint source generators, by using treatment technologies to control point sources and by adopting best management practices for nonpoint sources of pollution.</aftertext>

        <text><u>Authority</u>.</text>
        <text>The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe maintains the plenary sovereign power to regulate the quality of Tribal Surface Waters in the interest of the health and wellbeing of the Mohawk People.

          <text>Use Attainability. In the event that monitoring of water quality identifies reaches where attainable water quality is less than what is required by the Tribal Water Quality Standards, then the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe may modify the Water Quality Standards to reflect attainability. Modification shall then be within the sole discretion of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, but shall be subject to the provisions of the Clean Water Act, and shall be carried out in accordance with use-attainability analysis procedures required by 40 CFR 131.10. A designated use, that is not an existing use, may be removed if it is demonstrated that attaining the designated use is infeasible. Further, at a minimum, uses are considered attainable if they can be achieved by implementing effluent limits required under Sections 301(b) and 306 of the Clean Water Act (Act) and by implementing cost-effective and reasonable best management practices (BMPs) for nonpoint source control. (40 CFR 131.10(h)(2)). If the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe adopts a new or revised water quality standard based on a required use attainability analysis, the Tribe shall also adopt the highest attainable use, as defined in §131.3(m).</text>
          <text>A Use Attainability Analysis must be conducted whenever: (1) The Tribe designates or has designated uses that do not include the uses specified in section 101(a)(2) of the Act, or (2) The Tribe wishes to remove a designated use that is specified in section 101(a)(2) of the Act or to adopt subcategories of uses specified in section 101(a)(2) of the Act which require less stringent criteria. The regulation (at 40 CFR 131.10(g)) specifies that States and Tribes may remove a designated use which is not an existing use if attainment of a use is not feasible due to the following:</text>
          <para>

            <text>Natural, ephemeral, intermittent, or low flow conditions or water levels prevent the attainment of the use, unless these conditions may be compensated for by the discharge of sufficient volume of effluent discharges without violating State or Tribal water conservation requirements to enable uses to be met; or,</text>

            <num>(C)</num>
            <text>Human caused conditions or sources of pollution prevent the attainment of the use and cannot be remedied or would cause more environmental damage to correct than to leave in place; or;</text>

            <num>(D)</num>
            <text>Dams, diversions or other types of hydrological modifications preclude the attainment of the use, and it is not feasible to restore the water body to its original condition or operate such modification in a way that would result in the attainment of a use; or,</text>

            <text>Physical conditions related to the natural features of the water body, such as the lack of a proper substrate, cover, flow, depth, pools, riffles, and the like, unrelated to water quality, preclude attainment of aquatic life protection uses; or, f.

        <text>Antidegradation Policy:</text>
        <text>This antidegradation standard shall be applicable to any action or activity by any source, point or nonpoint, of pollutants that is anticipated to result in an increased loading of pollutants to Tribal surface waters. Pursuant to this standard:</text>
        <para>
          <num>(1)</num>
          <text>Existing instream water uses, as defined herein, and the level of water quality necessary to protect existing uses shall be maintained and protected.

          <text>Where, for any parameter, the quality of the waters exceed levels necessary to support the protection and propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife and recreation in and on the waters, that water shall be considered high quality for that parameter consistent with the definition of high quality water found at subsection of this antidegradation standard and that quality shall be maintained and protected unless the Tribe finds, after full satisfaction of Tribe's intergovernmental coordination and public participation provisions of the Tribe's continuing planning process, that allowing lower water quality is necessary to accommodate important economic or social development in the area in which the waters are located. In allowing such degradation, the Tribe shall assure water quality adequate to fully protect existing uses. Further, the Tribe shall assure that there shall be achieved the highest statutory and regulatory requirements for all new and existing point sources and all cost-effective and reasonable best management practices for nonpoint source control. The Tribe shall utilize the Antidegradation Implementation Procedures set forth below in determining if any lowering of water quality will be allowed;</text>

          <text>Whenever the natural conditions of surface water of the Tribe are of a lower quality than the aquatic life criteria assigned, the Division may determine that the natural conditions shall constitute the aquatic life water quality criteria. If a natural condition varies with time, the natural condition will be determined as the highest quality prevailing natural condition measured during an annual, seasonal, or shorter time period prior to influence of human-caused pollution. The Division may, at its discretion, determine a natural condition for one or more seasonal or shorter time period(s) to reflect variable ambient conditions.</text>

At the boundary between waters of different classifications, the water quality standards that are more stringent will prevail. When a distinction cannot be made between surface water, wetlands, groundwater, or sediments, then the applicable standards shall depend upon which existing or designated use is, or could be, adversely affected. If the uses of more than one resource are affected, than the most protective criteria shall apply.</text>

          <text>* It is estimated that during times of peak flow the Raquette River mixes with the St Lawrence at the point of intake for the SRMT drinking water treatment plant and provides a maximum contribution of approximately 15% to the SRMT drinking water intake. Under normal flow conditions it is estimated that this contribution is reduced to between 0% and 2% of daily intake.</text>
          <text>** Subsistence fish consumption has been an <strong>ongoing practice</strong>; however, the current WQ does not does not support this use for all individuals. Women of child bearing age and children are advised to restrict consumption to certain species and reduced quantities (fewer than 8, 4 oz. portions per month). SRMT currently defines subsistence fishing as consuming locally caught fish at a daily average rate of 150g/dy or 40 portions per month.</text>

          <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>
        </text>
        <text>It is the tradition of the Mohawk People to look generations forward in planning. It is with this foresight that the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Solid Waste Management Code ("Code") is intended.</text>
        <text>Solid waste disposal practices need to be maintained in good harmony with Mother Earth since these practices will have an effect on the future generations inheriting this land. Adherence to <cite path="|5.03">this chapter</cite> will ensure that best practices for solid waste management are maintained.</text>

          <strong>AUTHORITY</strong>
        </text>
        <text>The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe ("Tribe" or "SRMT") has the inherent authority to manage and regulate the storage, collection, transportation, handling, treatment and disposal of solid waste in a manner which best protects Mother Earth, her natural resources, and the health, welfare, and economic security of this generation of Mohawk People and the generations to follow.</text>
        <text>The Tribe retains the inherent sovereign power to exercise civil authority and jurisdiction over the conduct of both Tribal and non-Tribal members on all lands within the Saint Regis Mohawk Indian Reservation ("Reservation"). These civil actions will be taken when necessary to maintain the environment, natural resources, public health, safety, welfare, political integrity and economic security of the Tribe.</text>

          <strong>PURPOSE</strong>
        </text>
        <text><cite path="|5.03">This chapter</cite> does not allow for the improper disposal of any Solid Waste on the Reservation. Improper disposal or creating an Open Dump of any Solid Waste materials or recyclables, whether on the side of the road, in the Community Recycling Depot, or anywhere that they should not be disposed of, will be considered a violation of the Code. Disposal of such Solid Waste or creating an Open Dump site is different than someone who litters as outlined in the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Traffic Code <cite path="3.01.030|(e)|(6)">Section III(5)(f)</cite> (<cite doc="Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Res. No. 2018-09">TCR 2018-09</cite> or as amended).</text>
        <text>It is the intent of <cite path="|5.03">this chapter</cite> to create a comprehensive integrated waste management policy that requires all solid waste to be disposed of properly at management facilities on and off the Reservation. <cite path="|5.03">This chapter</cite> encourages Mohawk People to reduce, recycle and reuse those materials that do not belong in the waste stream. Education of the community through diverse media has been a continuing process, aimed at eliminating the poor solid waste disposal practices of the past.</text>
        <text>The Code intends to:</text>

          <strong>OPEN DUMPING</strong>
        </text>
        <text>The open dumping of Solid Wastes on the Reservation is disrespectful and does irreparable damage to the land and the environment. Much of this waste can last longer than seven generations and can affect even more generations through contamination of: soil, groundwater, and surface waters. Proper disposal of these materials can be accomplished through the utilization of Management Facilities, Haulers and/or taken directly off reservation to permitted disposal areas.</text>
        <text>It is a violation of <cite path="|5.03">this chapter</cite> for anyone or business to operate an Open Dump site. If there is an allegation of an Open Dump site it shall be investigated. The Open Dump site shall immediately cease to operate and violator will be subject to enforcement actions as outlined in <cite path="|5.03.060|(c)">Section 5.03.060(c)</cite>. if the matter was not resolved under <cite path="|5.03.030|(a)|(2)">Section 5.03.030(a)(2)</cite>.</text>
        <text>It is a violation of <cite path="|5.03">this chapter</cite> to dump, scatter or place any solid wastes anywhere except at a duly authorized and designated solid waste transfer station or landfill. Any written or verbal allegation of open dumping shall be forwarded to the Compliance Department to investigate. If the alleged violator's conduct does not cease after the Compliance Department has undertaken efforts to seek cooperation to stop the offending behavior, it may then determine whether to refer the matter to Tribal Police or the Environment Division for further enforcement action.</text>
        <text>If there are further enforcement actions and the matter is brought to the Tribal Court, it shall be dealt with according to <cite path="|5.03.060|(d)">Section 5.03.060(d)</cite>.</text>

        <text>All items to be included in the Household Hazardous Waste collection will be compiled on a list by the Director of the Environment Division. The permitted items will be announced in a locally circulated newspaper, the Tribe's website, social media and radio for at least three (3) consecutive weeks prior to collection activities. Disposal methods and containers will follow recognized standards established by United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Rules and regulations adopted by the Environment Division may be used if those methods specified meet or exceed the minimum standards established by USEPA and OSHA.</text>
        <text>If the Director or any employee involved with the collection of Household Hazardous Waste is in doubt regarding the safe handling of a product, then such product will be returned to the individual who transported it to the collection point.</text>
        <text>Collection of Household Hazardous Waste will occur based solely on the availability of funding.

        <text>As a condition for the issuance of a Solid Waste collection and transportation permit, the Tribe's Compliance Department shall require every vehicle operated by the Hauler to be conspicuously marked to identify it. Every vehicle shall be marked with the trade name of the Hauler, and the number of the transportation permit issued pursuant to this Section. Every vehicle and driver must be licensed and must comply with all safety and insurance requirements of the state or province from which he/she is licensed.</text>
        <text>After placement of Solid Wastes and recyclable materials at the roadside or other designated area approved by the Tribe for collection, such Solid Wastes and recyclable material shall be delivered to the SRMT Transfer Station located at 179 County Route 43, Fort Covington NY. In certain situations, the Hauler may be granted permission to <strong>by-pass</strong> the SRMT Transfer Station and deliver Solid Waste directly to the Franklin County Landfill. The Hauler must first provide enough historical data to establish a monthly average tonnage of Solid Waste being transported from the Reservation to the landfill. The Hauler will be charged a "Regional Fee". Regional Fees and "Transfer Station Price List" can be found on the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe's webpage (https://www.srmt-nsn.gov/).</text>
        <text>As a condition for the issuance of a Solid Waste collection and transportation permit, a Hauler agrees to make an annual report by December 1 of each year, to the Tribe's Compliance Department, indicating the number and type of installations emptied or cleaned, the quantity of Solid Wastes disposed of, the place and manner in which such Solid Wastes were finally disposed, quantity and types of recyclables collected, and such other information as the Compliance Department may require. A renewal application may be denied by the Compliance Department for failure of the Permittee or Hauler to properly and timely file an annual report.</text>
        <text>The Compliance Department on a calendar basis must renew solid waste permits for the collection and transportation annually. The Environment Division shall adopt rules and regulations for Solid Waste collection and transportation on the Reservation in consultation with the Compliance Department, including the operation of management facilities, and may impose whatever conditions it deems reasonably necessary to protect the environment, and the health, safety and welfare of the Tribe and its members before issuing any permit under this Section.</text>

      <heading>Purpose</heading>
      <text>The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe (The "Tribe"), is responsible for the health, safety, education and welfare of all community members. With respect to pesticide usage it has the authority, responsibility and jurisdiction to exercise sovereign rights in governing pesticide usage on the Saint Regis Mohawk Reservation (Reservation). Through its Environment Division, the Tribe has determined that the management of pesticides through Tribal regulation will ensure the protection of Tribal member health by reducing unnecessary health risk exposures to pesticides.</text>
      <text>Further, the EPA's regulations under Environmental Protection Acts, Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 171 provide that:</text>

        <num>(b)</num>
        <text>If a tribe does not develop its own certification plan, the tribe may choose to utilize a state's certification program, with the concurrence of that state, subject to the approval of EPA; or</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(c)</num>
        <text>EPA can implement a federal plan for the certification of applicators of RUPS where no other EPA-approved state or tribal applicator certification plan is in effect.</text>
      </para>
      <aftertext>The Tribe's strategy for regulating pesticide usage within its jurisdiction is to exercise option 3, relying upon EPA to certify RUP applicators. Additionally, the Tribe will exercise its sovereign right to regulate the use of General Use Pesticides (GUPS) within its jurisdiction through this regulation.</aftertext>

      <heading>Authority</heading>
      <text>The authority of the Tribe to enact the Pesticide Regulation lies in the inherent sovereign authority of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe the Tribal Procedures Act section IV (C) (1), (2), (10) and (13) (<cite doc="Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Res. No. 2013-32">TCR 2013-32</cite>); and the Tribal Court and Judiciary Code Section V and VI (TCR 2008- 22).</text>
      <text>Tribes cannot be granted primacy status under FIFRA. The EPA, however, does permit cooperative agreements to tribes who cooperate with EPA for the enforcement of FIFRA and who have developed their own Tribal Codes for pesticide use on tribal lands. If a tribal inspector uses tribal credentials for an inspection, enforcement can be pursued by the Tribal Council. If EPA credentials are used for an inspection, the Tribe shall send the inspection file and all information to the EPA's regional office.</text>

      <heading>Enforcement Actions</heading>
      <text>Enforcement Policy: It is the policy of the Tribe to encourage informal, practical, result- oriented resolution of alleged violations and actions needed to prevent damage to Saint Regis Mohawk Indian Reservation resources or harm to the health, safety or welfare of the Reservation population. It is also the policy of the Tribe, consistent with the principles of due process, to provide effective procedures for enforcement.</text>
      <text>Enforcement Agency: The Tribe's Environment Compliance Officer ("Officer") shall be responsible for enforcing the provisions of this Code. Specifically, the Officer shall conduct investigations when a complaint is received by the Tribal Compliance Office, Environment Division or other Tribal agency believes that a violation of this Ordinance has occurred.</text>
      <text>Enforcement Activities: Where a verified complaint shall be filed with the Tribe and reviewed by the Environmental Compliance Officer alleging that, or where the Tribe itself shall have cause to believe that, any person is violating any pesticide regulation or permit condition, the Environmental Compliance Officer shall cause a prompt investigation to be made.</text>
      <text>Notice of Violation: Cease and Desist Order: If the Officer finds after an investigation pursuant to this Code that a violation of any regulation or permit condition exists, the Officer shall promptly notify both the alleged violator and the Tribal Council in writing. In the case of an apparent violation of this Ordinance, the Officer is authorized to issue a Notice of Violation to the person(s) apparently responsible for the violation, and, if the apparent violation occurred on property owned by a person other than the alleged violator, a Notice of Violation shall also be issued to the landowner.</text>
      <text>In the case of a continuing violation or a threatened violation, the Tribal Council shall issue a Cease and Desist Order to prevent the violation from continuing or occurring.</text>
      <text>Failure to comply with a Cease and Desist Order shall constitute a Second violation of this Ordinance. Both a Notice of Violation and a Cease and Desist Order may be issued for a single incident. A Notice of Violation will include a request to appear before the Officer at an enforcement hearing at a specified time and date, and shall advise the alleged violator that failure to appear may result in the imposition of civil penalties.</text>
      <text>If an Immediate Cease and Desist Order is issued without an accompanying Notice of Violation, the Order will inform the recipient that failure to comply with the Order will constitute a violation of this Ordinance, which will result in the issuance of a Notice of Violation that will indicate the alleged violations of this ordinance and may result in the imposition of civil penalties.</text>

      <heading>Hearings on Violations</heading>
      <text>Informal/Formal Hearings: The Officer shall afford the landowner or his or her representative reasonable opportunities to discuss proposed enforcement actions at an informal or formal hearing prior to taking further enforcement action, unless the Officer determines that there may be either imminent environmental damage to a Reservation resource or adverse impact upon the health, safety and welfare of the Reservation population. Informal or formal hearings may be used at any stage in the enforcement proceedings, except that the Officer may refuse to conduct informal or formal hearings with respect to any matter then pending before the Officer.</text>
      <text>Reports Required: The Officer shall keep written notes of the date and place of the hearing, the persons in attendance, the subject matter discussed and any decisions reached with respect to further enforcement action.</text>
      <text>Enforcement Hearings: If the landowner and the Officer are unable to resolve the matter via an informal or formal hearing, the Officer is authorized to conduct adjudicatory hearings to determine if a violation of this Code has occurred. In such a hearing the person so charged shall be entitled, at his or her own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other representative. The Officer shall rule that a violation of this Ordinance has occurred if it finds that the charges are supported by a preponderance of the credible evidence, which supports a finding that a violation occurred.</text>
      <text>Within thirty (30) days after the date of any enforcement hearing, the Officer shall issue a written decision. If the Officer determines that a violation has occurred and that the person(s) charged was (were) responsible for the violation, the Officer's decision shall include an Enforcement Order.</text>
      <text>Civil Penalties and Corrective Action: An Enforcement Order shall direct any person(s) found to have committed a violation of this Ordinance to take whatever corrective action the Officer deems appropriate under the circumstances. An Enforcement Order may impose civil penalties in accordance with a schedule of civil penalties prescribed under these rules. Alternatively, an Enforcement Order may impose civil penalties in the event that a person found to have committed a violation of this Code does not take corrective action in accordance with the Order within a prescribed time frame. If a person who has been found to have committed a violation does not take corrective action within the prescribed time frame, an appropriate department or agency of the Tribal government may take the necessary corrective action, in which case the amount of any civil penalty shall be increased by twice the amount of the cost incurred by the Tribal department or agency in taking the corrective action.</text>
      <text>Notwithstanding any other provision of this Ordinance, if the Officer determines that noncompliance with this Ordinance is presenting an imminent and substantial threat to the public health, welfare or environment and determines, in consultation with the Tribe's attorneys, that it is not practicable to assure prompt protection of the public health, welfare or environment of an administrative or judicial enforcement action under this part, the Officer may issue such orders as may be necessary to protect the public health, welfare or environment. Any such order shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall remain in effect for a period not to exceed sixty (60) days. Revocation of Permit. Failure of any person to comply with any Enforcement Orders shall result in an immediate revocation of his or her permit. In order to obtain a reinstatement of such permit, the person(s) against whom the Enforcement Order was issued must first demonstrate compliance with the Order and pay all outstanding penalties and then petition for reinstatement of the permit with the name of the particular Tribal Agency].</text>
      <text>Special Provisions for Tribal Departments and Agencies: In any case in which any Tribal agency or department is alleged to have violated the terms and conditions of a pesticide permit, or to have conducted activities without a permit, the Compliance Department shall bring the matter to the attention of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, Tribal Council who shall consider taking action to ensure compliance with this Ordinance. If the matter cannot be resolved informally, the particular Tribal Agency shall conduct an enforcement hearing for the purpose of making factual determinations and issuing a decision recommending a course of corrective action if necessary.</text>
