        <strong>Purpose and Authority</strong>
      </text>
      <text>The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe believes that parents have a duty to care for their children and this duty applies to all parents whose parental rights have not been terminated. This duty includes providing love, guidance, education, providing a safe and healthy environment, participation in tribal culture, and to provide financial support.</text>
      <text>The purpose of this Act is to provide a process that ensures that the basic health and financial needs of the children are met when their parents do not live together. Child support is based on the financial resources of the parents, the financial needs of the children, and is an entitlement of the child.</text>
      <text>Culturally, children of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe are cared for by parents, extended family, and the community. This Act focuses on the parents' duty to meet the needs of their children.</text>
      <text>The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Council is the duly recognized governing body of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe and is responsible for the health, safety, education and welfare of all members of the Tribe, and in furtherance of those responsibilities, the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Council passes this Act.</text>

If the amount falls between the FPL and the SSR, then the presumptive amount will be $25.00 per month ($300.00 annually). If the amount falls below the FPL, then the presumptive amount will be $0.00.
