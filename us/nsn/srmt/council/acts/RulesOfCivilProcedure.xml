      <num>A.</num>
      <text>Failure of a defendant to file and serve an answer upon the plaintiff within twenty (20) days after the complaint was served shall be in default and shall provide grounds for judgment against the defendant as asked for in the complaint. No judgment of default shall be made, however, unless the plaintiff makes a written motion for a default judgment and serves a copy of the motion on each defendant. If defendant files an answer to the complaint at or before the time that the motion is to be argued to the Judge, no default judgment shall be granted, and the matter shall proceed as though answered on time. If defendant does not answer by that time, a default judgment shall be entered.</text>

      <num>A.</num>
      <text>It is the policy of the Tribal Court that the truth will be revealed if all parties in a civil case have access to all information and evidence related to the case.

      <text>A party may refuse to make available the information requested pursuant to this Rule if its release would cause the responding party or a third person undue hardship, annoyance, or embarrassment, or would violate a confidence which is Tribal custom or official Tribal policy to protect.

    <para>
      <num>A.</num>
      <text>In the interest of saving time, simplifying the issues and avoiding unnecessary litigation, the Judge may, on his or her own motion, or on the motion of any party, schedule one or more pretrial conferences with all parties to a case.

      <text>No party shall be permitted to use the testimony of any witness or introduce as evidence any document or object unless they disclose the witness, document, or object at the pretrial conference as provided in (c) above, unless the party proves that at the time of the pretrial conference they were unaware of the existence or nature of the witness, document or object and could not, with reasonable effort, have discovered it in time to disclose it. Such evidence must, in any case, be disclosed to the judge and opposing party as soon as possible before it may be offered in the trial.</text>

      <text>Motions may be made in writing or orally. If the motion is not made during and as a consequence of events at a trial or other hearing, the moving party shall notify other parties of the nature and basis of the motion and the hearing time at least ten (10) days before the motion is presented in Court, so the responding party has a chance to plan a response. The notice required by this section shall be called a Notice of Motion, shall be in writing, and shall be served upon the party, or, if the party is represented by counsel, upon the party's counsel, according to Section 4, Rule 1 (b).
