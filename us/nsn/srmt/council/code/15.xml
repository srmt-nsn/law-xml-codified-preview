        <text>Authority to adopt <cite path="|15.01">this chapter</cite> derives from the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe's ("Tribe") inherent sovereignty to regulate activities within Mohawk Tribal Territory that includes the authority to regulate hemp production and the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018, Pub. L. 115-334, December 20, 2018, 132 Stat. 4490 ("Farm Bill") and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's ("USDA") Final Rule (January 19, 2021), 86 FR 5596, recognizing a tribe's right to assume primary authority over hemp production.</text>

        <text>The Tribe's jurisdiction, as recognized in the USDA Final Rule, upon approval by USDA, extends to production of hemp with the Tribe's territory regardless of the extent of the Tribe's inherent regulatory authority.</text>

          <text>"Acceptable hemp THC level" is when the application of the measurement of uncertainty to the reported delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol content concentration level on a dry weight basis produces a distribution or range that includes 0.3% or less. For example, if the reported delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol content concentration level on a dry weight basis is 0.35% and the measurement of uncertainty is +/- 0.06%, the measured delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol content concentration level on a dry weight basis for this sample ranges from 0.29% to 0.41%. Because 0.3% is within the distribution or range, the sample is within the acceptable hemp THC level for plan compliance. This definition of "acceptable hemp THC level" affects neither the statutory definition of hemp, 7 U.S.C. ยง 1639o (1), in the 2018 Farm Bill nor the definition of "marihuana," 21 U.S.C. ยง 802(16), in the CSA.</text>

          <text>"Post decarboxylation" means a value determined after the process of decarboxylation that determines the total potential delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol content derived from the sum of the THC and THC-A content and reported on a dry weight basis. The post decarboxylation value of THC can be calculated by using a chromatograph technique using heat, gas chromatography, through which THCA is converted from its acid form to its neutral form, THC. Thus, this test calculates the total potential THC in a given sample. The post decarboxylation value of THC can also be calculated by using a high-performance liquid chromatograph technique, which keeps the THC-A intact, and requires a conversion calculation of that THC-A to calculate total potential THC in a given sample.</text>

          <text>"Total THC" is the value determined after the process of decarboxylation, or the application of a conversion factor if the testing methodology does not include decarboxylation, that expresses the potential total delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol content derived from the sum of the THC and THCA content and reported on a dry weight basis. This post-decarboxylation value of THC can be calculated by using a chromatograph technique using heat, such as gas chromatography, through which THCA is converted from its acid form to its neutral form, THC. Thus, this test calculates the total potential THC in a given sample. The total THC can also be calculated by using a liquid chromatograph technique, which keeps the THCA intact. This technique requires the use of the following conversion: [Total THC = (0.877 x THCA) + THC] which calculates the potential total THC in a given sample.</text>
