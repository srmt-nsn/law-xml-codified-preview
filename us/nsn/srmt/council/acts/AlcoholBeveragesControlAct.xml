    <heading>Policy:</heading>
    <text>In order to safeguard the public's safety, the Tribal Council has deemed it necessary to regulate and control the sale and distribution of Alcoholic beverages within the Saint Regis Mohawk Reservation ("Reservation") to promote temperance in consumption and respect for, and obedience to Tribal Law. It is hereby declared that such policy will best be carried out by empowering the Tribe's Compliance Department to determine whether the issuance of a License pursuant to this Appendix shall promote public convenience and advantage Tribal businesses and whether to increase or decrease the number of such Licenses. When considering a new License application, the Compliance Department also shall consider the proximity of each existing Licensed Premises to the proposed location. The denial of an application is subject only to the right of an Applicant to request the Compliance Department from reconsidering the denial based upon new information. If the Applicant is denied again then he/she can submit its request to Tribal Council for reconsideration.</text>
