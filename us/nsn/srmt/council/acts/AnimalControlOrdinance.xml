The evidence does not need to be competent or meet other evidentiary standards, but can be hearsay.  Once the Animal Control Officer has met the burden it shifts to the Owner to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the dog is not "dangerous".  If a dog has caused Serious Physical Injury then the Animal Control Officer shall file documentation such as medical reports, photographs, or police reports showing Serious Physical Injury and the Owner shall need to rebut the presumption that the dog is "dangerous".
