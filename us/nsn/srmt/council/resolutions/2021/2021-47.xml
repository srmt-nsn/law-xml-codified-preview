            <text>Basis for Using Small Estate Process. If a person dies and leaves an estate whose value is less than $20,000.00 and which does not include any interests in real property, the estate may be settled with minimal Tribal Court involvement so long as all of the heirs and beneficiaries agree to small estate administration and have signed a written waiver of their right to contest the estate. This may also include probate of personal property that is discovered from an estate that was informally probated prior to the enactment of <code-cite path="|attachments|law" doc="Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Res. No. 2021-47">this Law</code-cite>.</text>
