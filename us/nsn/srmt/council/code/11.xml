This duty includes providing love, guidance, education, providing a safe and healthy environment, participation in tribal culture, and to provide financial support.</text>
        <text>The purpose of <cite path="|11.03">this chapter</cite> is to provide a process that ensures that the basic health and financial needs of the children are met when their parents do not live together. Child support is based on the financial resources of the parents, the financial needs of the children, and is an entitlement of the child.</text>
        <text>Culturally, children of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe are cared for by parents, extended family, and the community. <cite path="|11.03">This chapter</cite> focuses on the parents' duty to meet the needs of their children.</text>
        <text>The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Council is the duly recognized governing body of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe and is responsible for the health, safety, education and welfare of all members of the Tribe, and in furtherance of those responsibilities, the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Council passes <cite path="|11.03">this chapter</cite>.</text>
