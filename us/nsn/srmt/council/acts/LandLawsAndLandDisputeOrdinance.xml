      <text>The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Council ("Tribal Council" or "Council") is the duly recognized governing body of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe ("Tribe") and is responsible for the health, safety, education and welfare of all members of the Tribe. The Tribe has the inherent authority to control the ownership of property and the issuance of use and occupancy deeds for property within the Tribe's Reservation. The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Tribal Clerk ("Tribal Clerk") has the authority to record title and land transfers that occur between members on the Reservation.</text>

      <text>This Ordinance is intended to set forth general rules for the issuance of deeds and the transfer of title and land interests on the Reservation.

      <text>"Interested Party" is any Tribal Member who claims to have an interest in the outcome of the proceeding and who seeks to participate in a land dispute proceeding. "Interested party" does not include a Tribal member without a recognizable interest in resolution of the case. A Tribal Member seeking to participate as an interested party and who has an identifiable and known legal interest in the disputed property shall be treated as an Intervenor and will be bound by the Court's rulings.</text>

      <text>"Land Dispute" is a disagreement between Tribal Members over claims to title, boundary lines, issuance or validity of deeds, transactions, and any other matter regarding property interests on the Reservation. The issuance of a Use and Occupancy Deed by the Tribe and the Tribal Clerk, even if in error, does not create a land dispute involving the Tribe. Any claim that a deed has been issued in error is to be resolved as a land dispute between the parties claiming an interest in the property and, when resolved, could result in a court order to the Tribe to issue a new deed or to revise or revoke an existing deed.</text>

      <text>Resolution of Ambiguity. Where any doubt arises as to past practices and customs, the Court, with the agreement of both parties, may request the advice of Tribal Members who may be familiar with the Tribe's customs and practices, or the Court may pose a certified question to the Tribal Council or the Tribal Clerk.

        <text><u>Power to Issue Deeds is Reserved</u>. The power to make land assignments and to issue Use and Occupancy Deeds is vested in the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Council as the sovereign government with jurisdiction and authority over the Reservation. The Tribal Council and the Tribal Clerk issue deeds in their official capacity based on deeds, contracts and other agreements or documents such as wills.</text>

      <para>
        <num>2.</num>
        <text><u>Resolution of Disputes</u>. The Tribal Council shall exercise its discretion and judgment in issuing deeds and it may do so upon request of a Tribal Member with the presentation of proper documentation. It is recognized that a request to the Council to issue a deed may change the ownership of land in a way that may negatively affect a Tribal Member. The issuance of a deed by the Tribal Council and the Tribal Clerk does not constitute the resolution of a land dispute. If a Tribal Member disagrees with the recordation or issuance of a deed, the remedy is to file a land dispute claim in Tribal Court.</text>

          <text>When two or more Tribal Members are listed as owners of property and are granted the interest simultaneously, the owners shall be deemed joint tenants with rights of survivorship, unless expressly declared to be tenants in common. As joint tenants, the owners will own equal undivided shares. Upon the death of one of the tenants, that share will be distributed equally to the remaining tenants (survivorship). A joint tenant may transfer his/her share, but that transfer will automatically change the ownership between the transferring joint tenant and the non- transferring joint tenants to tenants in common. The transfer does not change the relationship between the non-transferring joint tenants.</text>

          <text>If a deed declares the property will be held as tenants in common, each owner will own the property in equal shares unless different portions are expressly stated in the deed and each owner is entitled to possess the whole. A tenant in common may sell his/her share to anyone. If a tenant dies, there is no right of survivorship with the other tenants and that share will pass through inheritance as provided for in the Probate Ordinance.</text>

          <text>A deed held by a husband and wife creates a tenancy by the entirety, unless expressly declared to be a joint tenancy or a tenancy in common.

        <text><u>Land Contracts</u>. A land contract is an agreement between a buyer and seller for the purchase of a right to use and occupy a parcel of land where the buyer makes installment payments to the seller for the eventual conveyance of the Tribal Use and Occupancy Deed or right to occupy the property.

          <text>Each contract will differ, but many land contracts provide that the buyer may occupy and make improvements to the land, even though the complete right to use and occupy is not transferred until the land contract is fulfilled. Once executed, a land contract may be filed with the Tribal Clerk's office to provide notice to the community at large. If there are multiple land contracts the Tribal Court must have a hearing to determine which land contract takes precedence.</text>

The Tribal Court must have a hearing to determine if the buyer is entitled to any compensation. The Tribal Court must state its findings in a written order.</text>

        <text><u>Bill of Sale</u>. A Bill of Sale is a record of a purchase transaction between individuals for the exchange of their right to use and occupy a particular parcel of land and may stand as a deed conveying the right to use and occupy the property under tribal law.

          <text>In the past, Bills of Sale were not always recorded with the Tribal Clerk.
