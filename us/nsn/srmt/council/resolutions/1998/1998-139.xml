    <heading>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</heading>
    <text>The law firm of McNamee, Lochner, Titus &amp; Williams, P.C., was selected in March, 1996 to provide legal support and assistance to the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe, Environment Division, in developing an Akwesasne Wetlands Conservation Act (referred to below as the "Act"). The Act is designed to work in concert with the existing Wetlands Protection Plan and Environmental Assessment Procedure to comprehensively regulate and protect the critical Wetland resources of Akwesasne. When an applicant identifies potential wetlands impacts during the environmental assessment procedure, the requirement to submit a Wetlands Permit Application is triggered. In concert, these ordinances will provide the Environment Division with powerful tools to guide development and preserve environmental quality.</text>
    <text>In order to develop the Wetlands Act, Counsel to the Environment Division examined the Wetland protection plans of other Tribes, the Federal government, and New York State. Counsel worked with Environment Division staff, and in particular the Wetlands Biologist, to develop a Wetlands protection plan that protects the wetland ecosystems that have since time immemorial been central to Akwesasne culture.</text>
    <text>The Act consists of essentially five (5) elements. These elements are: policy, mapping of wetlands, public notice, permitting, and enforcement. Titles I and II set forth in clear terms the important policies that drive Wetland protection, and charge the Environment Division with the task of identifying Wetlands areas on the Reservation and publishing a Wetlands map. Through the diligent efforts of Environment Division staff, working closely with their consultants, the work of identification and mapping has been substantially completed.</text>
    <text>Title III sets forth the Wetlands Permitting Plan. In order to protect and preserve Wetlands for present and future generations, any person desiring to conduct on designated Wetlands any activity regulated under the Act must apply to the Environment Division for a Permit. By requiring Permit applications to be submitted to the Environment Division prior to development, the Tribe can impose conditions on such development, as needed, in order to guide growth in a manner that is protective of Tribal resources.</text>
    <text>Certain activities consistent with traditional, cultural uses of Wetlands are excepted from the Permit requirement. Included amongst the excepted activities are the collection, harvest and growth of medicinal and other plants. As part of its responsibilities under the Act, the Environment Division shall compile a list of medicinal plants, shrubs and herbs found in the Wetlands of Akwesasne. Thereafter, any person engaged in the collection, harvest or growth of such plants, shrubs and herbs shall be exempt from the permitting requirements. Also excepted, although subject to certain conditions, are traditional home-builder activities affecting less than .25 acres of Wetlands.</text>
    <text>Title IV establishes an Environmental Appeals Board. In an attempt to achieve balance and consensus regarding Wetlands and Water Quality protection, the Board is proposed to be staffed by representatives from the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe Environment Division, the St. Regis Mohawk Tribal Council, the Mohawk Council of Akwesasne, the Mohawk Nation of Chiefs, and three at-large members. The Board is empowered to hear appeals from Environment Division orders and permitting decisions in order to assure that all affected are provided with due process of law. The Board's review of the decisions of the Environment Division as they pertain to Wetlands is not unlimited, but empowers the Board to decide only the five issues enumerated in <code-cite path="ยง01-0402|2.">section 01-0402(2)</code-cite> of the Act.</text>
    <text>The Act will serve to protect the Wetlands and Water Quality of Akwesasne from undue encroachment and over-development. By regulating the human impact in the Wetlands, the Act will improve the quality of these ecosystems by returning them to their traditional state of balance.</text>
